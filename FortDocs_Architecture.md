This architecture document outlines the technical foundation for a document management system that combines military-grade encryption with intuitive user experience, leveraging Apple's latest frameworks including VisionKit for document scanning, CryptoKit for encryption, and CloudKit for secure synchronization.

The application addresses the growing need for secure document storage in an increasingly digital world, where sensitive documents such as identification papers, financial records, and legal documents require both accessibility and protection. By implementing a zero-knowledge architecture with local encryption and biometric authentication, FortDocs ensures that user data remains private and secure while providing the convenience of modern document management.

## System Overview

### Core Architecture Principles

FortDocs is built upon five fundamental architectural principles that guide every design decision and implementation detail. The privacy-by-design principle ensures that user data protection is not an afterthought but the foundation upon which all features are built. This means implementing end-to-end encryption, minimizing data collection, and ensuring that even the application developers cannot access user documents.

The security-first approach mandates that every component of the system must be evaluated through a security lens before functionality considerations. This includes implementing multiple layers of authentication, using hardware-backed encryption keys, and following Apple's security best practices throughout the codebase.

Local-first data management ensures that users maintain control over their documents, with cloud synchronization serving as a convenience feature rather than a requirement. This approach reduces dependency on external services and provides users with confidence that their documents remain accessible even without internet connectivity.

The seamless user experience principle recognizes that security measures should enhance rather than hinder usability. By leveraging Apple's native authentication methods and following Human Interface Guidelines, FortDocs provides enterprise-level security with consumer-friendly interaction patterns.

Finally, the future-ready design ensures that the architecture can accommodate emerging technologies and evolving security requirements without requiring fundamental restructuring.

### Technology Stack

The application leverages Apple's modern development ecosystem, built primarily with Swift 5.10 and SwiftUI for the user interface. This choice ensures optimal performance, native look and feel, and access to the latest iOS features. The SwiftUI framework provides declarative UI development with built-in support for accessibility, dark mode, and dynamic type sizing.

Core Data serves as the local persistence layer, enhanced with CloudKit integration for cross-device synchronization. This combination provides robust local storage with automatic conflict resolution and seamless data distribution across user devices.

CryptoKit handles all cryptographic operations, providing access to hardware-backed security features through the Secure Enclave. This ensures that encryption keys never exist in software-accessible memory, providing protection against both software and hardware attacks.

VisionKit powers the document scanning functionality, offering state-of-the-art document detection, perspective correction, and optical character recognition. The framework's integration with iOS provides optimized performance and battery efficiency.

Core Spotlight enables system-wide search integration, allowing users to find documents through Spotlight search while maintaining privacy through selective indexing of non-sensitive metadata.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Framework

The authentication system implements a multi-layered approach designed to balance security with user convenience. The primary authentication method utilizes Apple's LocalAuthentication framework to provide biometric authentication through Face ID or Touch ID, depending on device capabilities.

The biometric authentication system operates through a secure enclave-backed process where biometric templates never leave the device and cannot be accessed by applications. When a user attempts to access FortDocs, the system presents a biometric challenge that, upon successful completion, unlocks access to the application's encryption keys stored in the Keychain.

As a fallback mechanism, the system implements a custom 5-digit PIN authentication system. This PIN is not stored in plaintext but is processed through a key derivation function with device-specific salt values, ensuring that even if the device storage is compromised, the PIN cannot be easily recovered.

The authentication system includes progressive security measures to prevent brute force attacks. After three failed authentication attempts, the system introduces a 30-second delay. After five failed attempts, the delay increases to 5 minutes, and after ten failed attempts, the application locks for 24 hours. These delays are enforced through secure timestamp storage that cannot be bypassed by device manipulation.

### Encryption Implementation

FortDocs implements a sophisticated encryption architecture that ensures document security both at rest and during transmission. Each document is encrypted individually using AES-256-GCM encryption, providing both confidentiality and authenticity verification.

The encryption key hierarchy begins with a master key generated using the Secure Enclave's hardware random number generator. This master key is wrapped using a key encryption key (KEK) that is derived from the user's authentication credentials and device-specific hardware identifiers. The wrapped master key is stored in the iOS Keychain with the highest security attributes, including kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly.

Individual document encryption uses unique document keys derived from the master key using HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) with document-specific context information. This approach ensures that even if one document's encryption is compromised, other documents remain secure.

The encryption process includes integrity verification through authenticated encryption, ensuring that any tampering with encrypted documents can be detected. Each encrypted document includes a cryptographic signature that is verified during decryption, providing assurance of data integrity.

### Key Management

The key management system follows industry best practices for cryptographic key lifecycle management. Key generation occurs exclusively within the Secure Enclave when available, ensuring that keys are generated using true hardware random number generation and never exist in software-accessible memory.

Key storage utilizes the iOS Keychain Services with the most restrictive access controls. Keys are marked with kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly to ensure they cannot be accessed when the device is locked and cannot be synchronized to other devices through iCloud Keychain.

Key rotation is implemented as a background process that periodically generates new encryption keys while maintaining access to previously encrypted documents. This process ensures forward secrecy, where compromise of current keys cannot decrypt previously stored documents.

The system includes key recovery mechanisms that allow users to regain access to their documents after device restoration or migration, while maintaining security through multi-factor authentication and secure key escrow processes.

## Data Architecture

### Core Data Model

The data architecture centers around a carefully designed Core Data model that balances performance, security, and synchronization requirements. The primary entities include Document, Folder, Tag, and SearchIndex, each optimized for their specific use cases while maintaining referential integrity.

The Document entity serves as the central data structure, containing metadata such as creation date, modification date, file size, document type, and encrypted file path. Notably, the actual document content is not stored within Core Data but as encrypted files in the application's document directory, with Core Data maintaining only references and metadata.

The Folder entity implements a hierarchical structure supporting nested folders with unlimited depth. Each folder contains display properties such as name, color, icon, and sort order, along with relationship properties linking to contained documents and subfolders.

The Tag entity provides a flexible labeling system that allows users to categorize documents across folder boundaries. Tags support both user-created labels and system-generated tags derived from OCR content analysis.

The SearchIndex entity maintains searchable content extracted from documents, including OCR text, metadata, and user-generated annotations. This entity is designed to support fast full-text search while maintaining privacy through selective indexing of non-sensitive content.

### File System Organization

The file system architecture implements a secure container approach where all document files are stored within the application's sandbox in encrypted form. The directory structure follows a logical hierarchy that mirrors the user's folder organization while maintaining security through obfuscation.

Encrypted documents are stored with randomized filenames to prevent information leakage through file system analysis. The mapping between user-visible document names and encrypted file paths is maintained exclusively within the Core Data model, ensuring that file system access alone cannot reveal document organization or content.

The system implements atomic file operations to ensure data consistency during document creation, modification, and deletion. Temporary files are used during encryption and decryption operations, with secure deletion ensuring that unencrypted content never persists on storage media.

File versioning is implemented through a copy-on-write mechanism that maintains previous versions of documents while optimizing storage through deduplication of unchanged content blocks.

### Synchronization Strategy

The synchronization architecture leverages CloudKit to provide seamless data distribution across user devices while maintaining the privacy-first principles of the application. The synchronization system operates on a metadata-only approach, where document metadata and folder structure are synchronized through CloudKit, while encrypted document files are synchronized through iCloud Drive.

The synchronization process begins with metadata synchronization through NSPersistentCloudKitContainer, which automatically handles the complex process of translating Core Data changes into CloudKit operations. This includes conflict resolution, incremental updates, and network optimization.

Document file synchronization utilizes iCloud Drive's document-based synchronization, where encrypted files are stored in the application's iCloud container. The system monitors file coordination events to detect changes from other devices and updates local metadata accordingly.

Conflict resolution follows a last-writer-wins strategy for metadata changes, with special handling for document content conflicts. When document content conflicts are detected, the system creates conflict copies, allowing users to manually resolve differences.

The synchronization system includes offline support, ensuring that all application functionality remains available without network connectivity. Changes made offline are queued and synchronized when connectivity is restored.
